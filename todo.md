## Easy

- Remove items from PATH variable after app install (env vars have a length limit, we must keep it short):
    - vscode = C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft VS Code Insiders\bin
    - sqlserver odbc tools = C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\Client SDK\ODBC\170\Tools\Binn\
        C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\Client SDK\ODBC\130\Tools\Binn\
    - intel driver [Intel drivers add a lot of entries to my PATH, what can I delete?](https://superuser.com/questions/1242486/intel-drivers-add-a-lot-of-entries-to-my-path-what-can-i-delete)
- Add a special folder for trivia on the desktop, and synch it via BitBucket.
- Customize start menu: [Win10: Start Customization with LayoutModification.xml](https://winpeguy.wordpress.com/2015/10/30/win10-start-customization-with-layoutmodification-xml)
- Disable listing files in Quick-Access: https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3469-turn-off-recent-items-frequent-places-windows-10-a.html

## Medium

- After running a package script, running it again should update the package if needed, or reinstall if damaged.
- Provide a way to detect already installed applications, or if the action has already been done.
- Provide a way to remove an installed application, or reverse something that was done.
- Create a VBScript to create scheduled tasks, since `SCHTASKS` is limited in the parameters that it can use to create tasks.

## Hard

- A tool to select packages should be provided, and be able to create standalone initialization scripts, resilient to computer restarts,
and other system instabilities or natural events.
